                Leveraging analytics and problem-solving skills acquired as a biochemist with software
                engineering training, I look to cross the chasm between technology and practical application. 
                Technically proficient in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and a variety of other programming 
                languages, I am seeking Full Stack Developer opportunities to create applications to improve 
                our overall quality of life. As a graduate of the Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive 
                program and former college lecturer, I have further developed the ability to communicate 
                technical applications effectively.
